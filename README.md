This **Android Library** fulfills all requirements that can be thought of using a beautiful counter.
It can be used as:

* Tally Counter

The repository has the following **library examples**:

 * **Tally Counter Example:** This example shows the simplest application of this library: Simply incrementing and decrementing the counter.
 * **Timer Example:** This example shows the usage of the General Counter as a counter that increments every second (In short: A **Seconds Clock** ).
